# Info

This app is absolutely vibe coded and the code is a horrible mess. 
I will probably never fix it myself because I am lazy asf. 
> To be fair that's the reason I created the app lol.

## How to use it

To be honest. **Don't**. It wouldn't help you much because it is strictly custom build to suit my needs.
You can tune it if you want so that it matches your preferences.

If you did that then here is a step by step of how it works.

1. The app asks you which day of the week you would like help with.
2. The app asks if you have lectures that day.
   * if yes it asks for start and end time of the lectures.
3. The app asks whether or not you have finished your work for uni.
   * if yes it will allocate time for a goal you have. *(in my case that is studying math)*
   * if no it will allocate time for you to do your work for uni.

That's it.

### Final notes
 - **No** you **can not** select the goal as an option it is **hardcoded** and you have to change it.
 - The way it calculates when you go to work is also **hardcoded**. Right now it takes into account that I work 4 days a week on certain days.
 - Occasionally the app just messes up the schedule for the day and creates overlapping tasks. But that's rare *(kinda)*.
 - I do not plan on keeping up this whole development gig for this app so yeah if you have an issue do a PR I might approve it (*if I see it*).
